        Investigating the effect that the mass of sodium chloride in water has
        on its specific heat capacity
      </h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Have you ever been told to add salt to the water to help it to heat
        faster? Or noticed that the time it takes to heat water varies with the
        amount of water you are heating?
      </p>
      <p>
        These ideas may seem basic but are the basis of this IA and the idea of
        specific heat capacity. The heat capacity of an object is defined as the
        amount of thermal energy required to increase that object's temperature
        by 1 K (Khan Academy 2021). However, this measurement isn't particularly
        useful because if the amount (mass, volume or moles) of that object
        changes, the heat capacity must be recalculated. The concept of specific
        heat capacity is founded on the assumption that the amount of a
        substance is directly proportional to its heat capacity. Using this
        assumption, specific heat capacity can be defined as the amount of
        thermal energy required to heat one amount unit (1 kilogram, 1 mole, 1
        metre cubed) of a substance by 1 K (Tsokos 2014). Most commonly, and
        throughout this IA, specific heat capacity refers to the amount of
        thermal energy required to heat 1 kg of a substance by 1 K.
      </p>
      <p>
        After studying specific heat capacity in class, I found myself
        unsatisfied with not knowing why specific heat capacity varies between
        substances. To understand why the specific heat capacity varies between
        substances, it is first helpful to investigate the concept of
        temperature. Temperature is directly proportional to the average random
        kinetic energy within an object (Tsokos 2014). Since this
        proportionality is so strict, it can be said that any other store of
        energy that isn't random kinetic will increase the specific heat
        capacity. This introduces many factors that can affect specific heat
        capacity, such as chemical bonds. One such factor that, according to
        Richard Feynman, is particularly important, is the number of 'degrees of
        freedom' a given molecule has. Each degree of freedom represents a
        parameter that is required to describe the motion of a molecule
        (LibreTexts 2017). Only some of the energy used to heat a substance will
        go toward degrees of freedom that increase the temperature, and the
        number of degrees of freedom varies between molecules.
      </p>
      <p>
        To investigate specific heat capacity further, I decided to explore
        sodium chloride dissolved in water. I decided to investigate it at
        different concentrations, which led me to my research question:
      </p>
      <p class="italic font-bold">
        How does the mass of sodium chloride dissolved in water affect the
        specific heat capacity of the solution?
      </p>
      <p>
        This experiment will involve finding the specific heat capacity of
        different sodium chloride solutions.
      </p>
      <p>The specific heat capacity formula is the following:</p>
      <h3 class="text-gray-600 text-sm">Equation 1</h3>
      <Math
        latex={String.raw`Q=mc \Delta T`}
        whereList={[
          {
            propertyAsLatex: "Q",
            value: "Energy in",
            unitAsLatex: "J",
          },
          {
            propertyAsLatex: "m",
            value: "Mass of substance in",
            unitAsLatex: "kg",
          },
          {
            propertyAsLatex: "c",
            value: "Specific heat capacity in",
            unitAsLatex: String.raw`J\cdot kg^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}`,
          },
        ]}
      />
      <p>It can be rearranged to find the specific heat capacity:</p>
      <h3 class="text-gray-600 text-sm">Equation 2</h3>
      <Math latex={String.raw`c=\frac{Q}{m \Delta T}`} />
      <p>
        In this experiment, a sodium chloride solution is heated and then mixed
        with a substance of known mass and heat capacity. The energy transfer to
        the substance of known mass and heat capacity is calculated using
        equation 1. The mass, temperature change of sodium chloride solution and
        calculated energy transfer is substituted into equation 2 to give the
        specific heat capacity of the sodium chloride solution. Equation 3
        represents this in a single equation.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-gray-600 text-sm">Equation 3</h3>
      <Math
        latex={String.raw`c_{s}\ =\ \frac{m_{w}c_{w} \Delta T_{w}}{m_{s} \Delta T_{s}}`}

          },
          {
            propertyAsLatex: String.raw`c_{w}`,
            value: "Specific heat capacity of the known substance in ",
            unitAsLatex: String.raw`J\cdot kg^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}`,
          },
          {

        ]}

      <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
      <p>
        Equation 3 states an inverse proportionality between the specific heat
        capacity of the solution and the mass of the solution. However, this
        proportionality is invalid. A proportionality derived from an equation
        must be able to be represented as a linear function, where all other
        variables are distilled into a gradient constant. The other variables in
        this equation are expected to not be constant, so proportionality cannot
        be assumed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sodium chloride has a specific heat capacity of <InlineMath
          latex={String.raw`864 J \cdot kg^{−1} \cdot K^{−1}`}
        /> (Chase 1998). Given this value, it is clear that dissolving sodium chloride
        in water would lower its specific heat capacity. The proportionality between
        the mass of sodium chloride and water would not be direct since the Y-intercept
        is expected to be the specific heat capacity of water, <InlineMath
          latex={String.raw`4186 J \cdot kg^{−1} \cdot K^{−1}`}
        /> (Engineering Toolbox n.d.). It is difficult to predict the type of correlation
        that exists between the two variables since no known equation accurately
        relates the two with a constant. The domain of this graph would be from 0
        kilograms to the saturation point for water and salt. Beyond the saturation
        point, we may reasonably assume different behaviour since the material is
        no longer a liquid and will have different properties.

      </ul>
      <h2>Method</h2>
      <p>
        Initially, I wanted to pursue an experiment that investigated specific
        heat capacity by heating solutions rather than cooling them down. To
        achieve this, I decided to place a heating element in the solution along
        with a thermometer, noting how long the solution took to reach the
        desired temperature. I started this experiment with my control trial of
        0 sodium chloride. My method initially appeared accurate. Unfortunately,
        when I performed my second trial using a sodium chloride solution, I
        discovered that the solution had undergone electrolysis. Since the
        changed solution may have different thermal properties, I decided to
        look for other ways to find the heat capacity. I considered indirectly
        heating the water but ruled it out on the basis of difficulty with the
        school lab equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I abandoned the idea of heating solutions to find their heat capacity
        and began to explore cooling solutions. The below method is the one I
        eventually decided on.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Record the mass of the calorimeter.</li>
        <li>
          Fill the beaker with water so that when the test tube is filled with
          25ml of solution and submerged in the water, the water level is above
          that of the solution.
        </li>
        <li>Place the beaker on the hot plate and heat to above 90°C.</li>
        <li>Fill calorimeter with 150ml of distilled water.</li>
        <li>
          Submerge the digital thermometer in the calorimeter and record the
          temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dissolve <InlineMath latex={String.raw`5.00\times10^{-4}\:kg`} /> of salt
          in 25ml of water.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer the solution into the test tube and submerge the test tube in
          water. Heat to 90°C exactly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once heated, transfer the solution to the calorimeter quickly and
          start the digital thermometer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Record the temperature of the combined solution once the thermometer
          stabilises in temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
          Record the combined final weight of the solution and water. Discard
          the combined solution.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat steps 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 for different amounts of sodium chloride,
          including a control trial with 0kg of sodium chloride.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Calculation of specific heat capacity</h3>
      <p>To calculate specific heat capacity, we will use equation 3:</p>
      <Math
        latex={String.raw`c_{s}\ =\ \frac{\textcolor{blue}{m_{w}c_{w} \Delta T_{w}}}{\textcolor{red}{m_{s} \Delta T_{s}}}`}
      />
      <p>
        Equation 3 has two components, the first, in blue, is the energy
        transferred to the distilled water that was already in the calorimeter.
        Since we measured the mass of this water to be 150ml, we will use that
        value for <InlineMath latex={String.raw`m_{w}`} />. For <InlineMath
          latex={String.raw`c_{w}`}
        />, we are using distilled water, so we will use the textbook value for
        water's specific heat capacity, <InlineMath
          latex={String.raw`4186 \:kg J\cdot kg^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}`}
        /> (Engineering Toolbox n.d.). We measured the temperature of the distilled
        water before adding the sodium chloride solution and the temperature after
        adding the sodium chloride solution, we can use these values to calculate
        a temperature delta, <InlineMath latex={String.raw`\Delta T_{w}`} />.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the second component (in red), the mass of the solution (<InlineMath
          latex={String.raw`m_{s}`}
        />) is calculated by subtracting the mass of the distilled water
        (0.15kg) from the measured mass of the combined solution. This way, any
        solution that evaporated is accounted for. The temperature delta (<InlineMath
          latex={String.raw`\Delta T_{s}`}
        />) for this component is calculated similarly, except the initial
        temperature value is 363 K since that is the temperature we heated the
        solution to.

      <h2>Analysis and Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Figure 2 is fitted with a linear line of best fit. No linearisation was
        used because a theoretical proportionality was not determined, and the
        linear line of best fit appears to sufficiently model the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some issues with using a linear line of best fit. As discussed
        in the hypothesis section, the domain of the line of best fit would be
        from 0 to the maximum concentration of sodium chloride in water. The
        maximum mass of sodium chloride dissolved in water at 25°C is 0.009 kg
        (Engineering Toolbox n.d). When extrapolated, the graph does not predict
        an unreasonable result for 0.009 kg of sodium chloride dissolved.

        The Y-intercept of the line of best fit represents the specific heat
        capacity of distilled water. The expected Y-intercept is <InlineMath
          latex={String.raw`4186 \: J\cdot kg^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}`}
        />, so our Y-intercept is relatively accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gradient of the line of best fit has the units <InlineMath
        latex={String.raw`J\cdot kg^{-1}\cdot K^{-1} \cdot kg^{-1}`}
      />. This is the specific heat capacity per kilogram of salt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Figure 2 shows a negative, linear correlation. The points on the graph
        lie close to the trendline and the trendline passes through all the
        error bars. Some points, like the last 2, deviate further from the
        trendline. This error does not appear to be systematic and is likely
        random. The trendline passes through the error bars of these points, and
        there are no other reasonable grounds to remove them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Figure 2 also features minimum and maximum lines of best fit, both of
        which pass through all the error bars. The minimum and maximum lines of
        best fit are used to calculate uncertainty in the gradient.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gradient has a reasonable, but not inconsiderable uncertainty. This
        indicates that there are some issues with precision in this data that
        could be improved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The accuracy of the collected data could be considered to be good since
        it is within the expected order of magnitude based on literature values
        for specific heat capacity (Engineering Toolbox n.d.). The control trial
        of 0 grams of sodium chloride measured a specific heat capacity of <InlineMath
          latex={String.raw`4274 \cdot kg^{−1} \cdot K^{−1}`}
        />, which is within 3% of the literature value, <InlineMath
          latex={String.raw`4186 \cdot kg^{−1} \cdot K^{−1}`}
        />.
      </p>
      <p>
        The evidence gathered in this experiment supports the mass of sodium
        chloride dissolved in distilled water being proportional to the inverse
        of specific heat capacity of that solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Specific heat capacity and sodium chloride have applications and
        implications. Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion is a process where the
        warm surface of the ocean is used to vaporise a substance of low boiling
        point which spins a turbine (Lynn et al. 2018). Ocean Thermal Energy
        Conversion is currently a process with only 3-5% efficiency, so there is
        potential for great improvements. It was found in a 2018 study that as
        the specific heat capacity of the water decreased due to salt content,
        the amount of electricity generated per unit temperature decreased in
        these systems.
      </p>
      <h2>Evaluation</h2>
      <p>
        The design and method of this investigation were suitable for reaching a
        viable conclusion. However, the experiment experienced some systematic
        and random error that impacted the accuracy and precision of the data.

                The solution in the test tube was not evenly heated since there
                is a temperature gradient in the beaker of water that is
                replicated in the test tube. The amount of mixing of the
                solution was not controlled and the final temperature of the
                solution was not recorded.

                The experiment assumes an even temperature distribution across
                the solution. This issue means that the average temperature over
                the solution could be significantly above or below the value
                used (90°C).

              <td>
                The conductor of the experiment could control the stirring
                periods and ensure the solution is evenly heated by moving the
                thermometer around the solution before combining the solution
                and distilled water in the calorimeter.

              <td>
                The solution in the test tube sometimes had a considerable
                amount of time out of the water as it was being transferred to
                calorimeter.
              </td>
              <td>
                Being out of the water meant that the solution could have cooled
                down, further invalidating the 90°C value used in calculations.
              </td>
              <td>
                The conductor of the experiment could move the calorimeter and
                hot plate closer together to minimise the time out of water. The
                conductor could also consider some kind of insulation for the
                test tube.

                While not visually apparent, I noticed that between trials the
                values of specific heat capacity would also vary with the
                calorimeter I used. This is despite the calorimeters being
                seemingly identical. This would add some random errors in the
                data.

                Do not conduct multiple trials concurrently. Only use one
                calorimeter.

                The calorimeter was cold for the first trial in each session I
                conducted this experiment.

                Some thermal energy would be lost due to heating the calorimeter
                in the first trial. This would mean the final temperature value
                may be slightly lower for these trials.
