      Investigating the effect that the mass of salt in water has on its
      specific heat capacity
    </h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    Have you ever been told to add salt to water to help it boil faster? 
    <h3>Research question</h3>
    <p>
      After an experiment in class, I found I was keen to explore the concept of
      specific heat capacity further. I thought that the link between the mass
      of salt dissolved in water and specific heat capacity would be interesting
      to investigate. Hence, my research question is:
    </p>
    <p class="italic font-bold">
      How does the mass of salt dissolved in water affect the specific heat
      capacity of the solution?
    </p>
    <h2>Theory</h2>
    <p>
      The specific heat capacity is a constant value existing for each unique
      material. It is defined by the amount of energy it takes to heat 1
      kilogram of that material by 1 kelvin. To calculate the specific heat
      capacity, one must measure the amount of thermal energy transferred into
      or out of a material of known mass. Often, this value is used to calculate
      the amount of energy required to change a material's temperature:
    </p>
    <h3>Equation 1</h3>
    <Math
      latex={String.raw`Q=mc \Delta T`}
      whereList={[
        {
          propertyAsLatex: "Q",
          value: "Energy in",
          unitAsLatex: "J",
        },
        {
          propertyAsLatex: "m",
          value: "Mass of substance in",
          unitAsLatex: "kg",
        },
        {
          propertyAsLatex: "c",
          value: "Specific heat capacity in",
          unitAsLatex: String.raw`J\cdot kg^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}`,
        },
      ]}
    />
    <p>We can rewrite this equation for specific heat capacity:</p>
    <h3>Equation 2</h3>
    <Math latex={String.raw`c=\frac{Q}{m \Delta T}`} />
    <p>
      In this experiment, the magnitude of energy transfer is measured as the
      material cools when combined with another material of known heat capacity.
      We find the magnitude of this energy transfer by substituting the
      temperature drop of the known material into equation 1, then substituting
      that into equation 2. This produces the following:
    </p>
    <h3>Equation 3</h3>
    <Math
      latex={String.raw`c_{s}\ =\ \frac{m_{w}c_{w} \Delta T_{w}}{m_{s} \Delta T_{s}}`}
      whereList={[
        {
          propertyAsLatex: String.raw`c_{s}`,
          value: "Specific heat capacity of solution in",
          unitAsLatex: String.raw`J\cdot kg^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}`,
        },
        {
          propertyAsLatex: String.raw`m_{w}`,
          value: "Mass of material of known specific heat capacity in",
          unitAsLatex: String.raw`kg`,
        },
        {
          propertyAsLatex: String.raw`c_{w}`,
          value: "Specific heat capacity of known material in ",
          unitAsLatex: String.raw`J\cdot kg^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}`,
        },
        {
          propertyAsLatex: String.raw`\Delta T_{w}`,
          value: "Temperature change of known material in",
          unitAsLatex: String.raw`K`,
        },
        {
          propertyAsLatex: String.raw`m_{s}`,
          value: "Mass of salt solution in",
          unitAsLatex: String.raw`kg`,
        },
        {
          propertyAsLatex: String.raw`\Delta T_{s}`,
          value: "Temperature change of salt solution in",
          unitAsLatex: String.raw`K`,
        },
      ]}
    />
    <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
    <p>
      Equation 3 relates the specific heat capacity to the mass of the solution.
      The equation states an inverse proportionality between the specific heat
      capacity of the solution and the mass of salt in the solution. Given this
      relationship, it is expected that as the mass of salt increases, the
      specific heat capacity decreases at a decreasing rate. The graph of mass
      of salt against the inverse of the specific heat capacity will have a
      positive, linear correlation. Since a mass of 0 salt in the water would be
      distilled water, the graph is expected to have a y-intercept of
      <InlineMath latex={String.raw`4186 J \cdot kg − 1 \cdot K − 1`} />

    <h2>Apparatus</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1x hot plate</li>
      <li>1x 1000ml beaker</li>
      <li>1x test tube</li>
      <li>1x retort stand</li>
      <li>1x clamp</li>
      <li>2x analogue thermometer</li>
      <li>1x digital thermometer</li>
      <li>1x calorimeter</li>
      <li>1x computer with relevant software for thermometer</li>
      <li>0.05kg sodium chloride (table salt)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>
      Initially, I wanted to pursue an experiment that investigated specific
      heat capacity by heating solutions rather than cooling them down. In order
      to achieve this, I decided to place a heating element in the solution
      along with a thermometer, noting how long the solution took to reach a
      desired temperature. I started this experiment with my control trial of 0
      salt. My method initially appeared accurate. Unfortunately, when I
      performed by second trial using a salt solution, I discovered that the
      solution had undergone electrolysis. Since the changed solution may have
      different thermal properties, I decided look for other ways to find the
      heat capacity. I considered indirectly heating the water but ruled it out
      on the basis of difficulty with the school lab equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I abandoned the idea of heating solutions to find their heat capacity and
      began to explore cooling solutions. The below method is the one I
      eventually decided on.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Record the mass of calorimeter.</li>
      <li>
        Fill the beaker with water so that when the test tube is filled with
        25ml of solution and submerged in the water, the water level is above
        that of the solution.
      </li>
      <li>Place the beaker on the hot plate and heat to above 90°C.</li>
      <li>Fill calorimeter with 150ml of distilled water.</li>
      <li>
        Submerge the digital thermometer in the calorimeter and record the
        temperature.
      </li>
      <li>Dissolve <InlineMath latex={String.raw`5.00\times10^{-4}\:kg`}></InlineMath> of salt in 25ml of water.</li>
      <li>
        Transfer solution into test tube and submerge test tube in water. Heat
        to 90°C exactly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once heated, transfer solution to calorimeter quickly and start the
        digital thermometer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Record the temperature of combined solution once the thermometer stabilises. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Record the combined final weight of solution and water. Discard the
        combined solution.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat steps 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 for different amounts of salt, including a
        control trial with 0kg of salt.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <div class="border border-solid border-red-700 p-3 my-5">
      <span class="text-red-700">SAFETY PRECAUTIONS:</span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The test tube is extremely hot after it is heated to 90°C. Use gloves
          and take care with the liquid.
        </li>
        <li>
          The hot plate is extremely hot. Stay aware of it and keep hands clear.

    <h3>Calculation of specific heat capacity</h3>
    <p>In order to calculate specific heat capacity, we will use equation 3:</p>
    <Math
      latex={String.raw`c_{s}\ =\ \frac{\textcolor{blue}{m_{w}c_{w} \Delta T_{w}}}{\textcolor{red}{m_{s} \Delta T_{s}}}`}
    />
    <p>
      Equation 3 has two components, the first, in blue, is the energy
      transferred to the distilled water that was already in the calorimeter.
      Since we measured the mass of this water to be 150ml, we will use that
      value for <InlineMath latex={String.raw`m_{w}`} />. For <InlineMath
        latex={String.raw`c_{w}`}
      />, we are using distilled water, so we will use the textbook value for
      water's specific heat capacity, <InlineMath
        latex={String.raw`4186 \:kg J\cdot kg^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}`}
      /> (Engineering Toolbox n.d.). We measured the temperature of the distilled
      water before adding the salt solution and the temperature after adding the
      salt solution, we can use these values to calculate a temperature delta, <InlineMath
        latex={String.raw`\Delta T_{w}`}
      />.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the second component (in red), the mass of the solution (<InlineMath
        latex={String.raw`m_{s}`}
      />) is calculated by subtracting the mass of the distilled water (0.15kg)
      from the measured mass of combined solution. This way, any solution that
      evaporated is accounted for. The temperature delta (<InlineMath
        latex={String.raw`\Delta T_{s}`}
      />) for this component is calculated in a similar way, except the initial
      temperature value is 363 K since that is the temperature we heated the
      solution to.

    <h3>Propagation of uncertainty in specific heat capacity</h3>
    <p>
      Take equation 3, <InlineMath
        latex={String.raw`c_{s}\ =\ \frac{m_{w}c_{w} \Delta T_{w}}{m_{s} \Delta T_{s}}`}
      /> to be <InlineMath latex={String.raw`a=\frac{bcd}{ef}`} />
    </p>
    <p>Uncertainty in specific heat capacity is then:</p>
    <Math
      latex={String.raw`\frac{\Delta a}{a} = \frac{\Delta b}{b} + \frac{\Delta c}{c} + \frac{\Delta d}{d} + \frac{\Delta e}{e} + \frac{\Delta f}{f}`}
    />
    <p>
      However, c is the known value of specific heat capacity for distilled water, so it
      does not need to be considered:
    </p>
    <Math
    latex={String.raw`\frac{\Delta a}{a} = \frac{\Delta b}{b} + \frac{\Delta d}{d} + \frac{\Delta e}{e} + \frac{\Delta f}{f}`}
    />
    <h4>Example propagation for salt mass of 0.0005kg, trial 2:</h4>
    <p>Find fractional uncertainty:</p>
    <Math
      latex={String.raw`\frac{0.0001}{0.15} + \frac{0.25}{301.6−291.9} + \frac{0.000002}{0.17414−0.15} + \frac{0.25}{363−301.8} = 0.0306076799`}
    />
    <p>Convert to absolute and round to a single significant figure:</p>
    <Math
      latex={String.raw`0.0306076799 \cdot 4196.310053 = 126.18 \Rightarrow 100 \: J\cdot kg^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}`}

    <h3>Graph</h3>
    <img class="min-w-full" src="images/graph.svg" alt="Graph of data" />
    <p>
      This graph shows the mass of salt against the specific heat capacity. The
      graph is linearised according to the hypothesis. The error bars were used
      to create min and max lines of best fit.
    </p>
    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      The hypothesis predicted that the graph of mass of salt against the
      inverse of the specific heat capacity will have a positive, linear
      correlation. The gradient of the main trendline on the graph proves this
      prediction. This trendline is valid since it passes through all the error
      bars. The maximum and minimum lines of best fit, while maintaining the
      positive, linear correlation, do not pass through the error bars,
      invalidating them. This is indicative of some random error in the data.

      <li>
        Best fit gradient: <InlineMath
          latex={String.raw`0.0142 \: J\cdot kg^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}`}
        />
      </li>
      <li>
        Min fit gradient: <InlineMath

      <li>
        Max fit gradient: <InlineMath
          latex={String.raw`0.0164 \: J\cdot kg^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}`}
        />
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradient: <InlineMath
          latex={String.raw`0.0142 \pm 0.00535 \: J\cdot kg^{-1}\cdot K^{-1}`}
        />
      </li>
      <li>Gradient percentage uncertainty: 37.6%</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The gradient has a large uncertainty. This means the precision could be
      greatly improved. Despite issues with precision, the data does appear to
      be rather accurate since the points appear consistently close to the best
      fit gradient. There are two possible anomalies at 0.0025 and 0.003. The
      former sits below the average trendline shown by other points and the
      latter sits well above the trendline. Considering the error bars however,
      both points could reasonably sit on the trendline.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      In conclusion, the mass of sodium chloride in a solution is proportional
      to the inverse of its specific heat capacity.
    </p>
    <h2>Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
      The design and method of this investigation was suitable for reaching a
      viable conclusion. However, the experiment experienced some systematic and
      random error that impacted the accuracy and precision of the data.

            The solution in the test tube was not evenly heated since there is a
            temperature gradient in the beaker of water that is replicated in
            the test tube. The amount of mixing of solution was not controlled
            and final temperature of solution was not recorded.

            The experiment assumes an even temperature distribution across the
            solution. This issue means that the average temperature over the
            solution could be significantly above or below the value used
            (90°C).

            The conductor of experiment could control the stirring periods and
            ensure the solution is evenly heated by moving the thermometer
            around the solution before combining the soution and distilled water
            in calorimeter.

            Being out of the water meant that the solution could have cooled

            The conductor of the experiment could move the calorimeter and hot
            plate close together to minimise the time out of water. The
            conductor could also consider some kind of insulation for the test
            tube. Alternatively, a second person could measure the temperature
            of solution before entering the water.

            While not visually apparant, I noticed that between trials the

            identical. This would add some random errors in the data.

            Some thermal energy would be lost due to heating the calorimeter in
